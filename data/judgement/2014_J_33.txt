the company was in heavy arrears as on 3rd january1977 to the extent of rs 1 14 crores.	F
accordingly the district collector meerut appointed a receiver under section 286 a of u p zamindari abolition and land reforms acthereinafter referred to as the zamindari abolition act.	F
subsequently the company was acquired by the state on 28th october1984.	F
as per provisions of the u p state sugar undertakings acquisition act1971 hereinafter referred to as the acquisition act1971as amended in the year 1984free from all encumbrances and the said unit was vested with the u p state sugar corporation hereinafter referred to as the corporation.	F
since the company was in arrears to the extent of rs 1 29 crores the district collector meerut by order dated 28th november1984attached all the remaining five constituent units except the sugar mill.	F
the general manger of the aforesaid sugar unit was appointed as a receiver with reference to all the aforesaid remaining five units.	F
in between 1977 to 1984for smooth functioning of the sugar mill payment of dues to sugarcane grower repairing of machinery etc.	F
on the request of the receiver the state government granted loan of rs 6 13 crores to the company and was to be recovered as the arrears of land revenue along with interest.	F
the district collector meerut taking into consideration the dues to the extent of rs 1 62 crores as on 24th october1990 were to be paid by the company extended the tenure of the receiver till further orders.	F
the order of the extension of tenure of the receiver was challenged by the ex proprietors of the company in a writ petition no 184961991 subsequently the receiver was withdrawn on 18th december1995therefore the writ petition was also withdrawn.	F
pursuant to uttar pradesh imposition of ceiling of land holdings act hereinafter referred to as the ceiling actland admeasuring 723 3 bigha belonging to the company was declared surplus.	F
against the same a writ petition no 39051987 was preferred by the company.	F
during the pendency of the aforesaid writ petition the state government issued a notification dated 14th august1987 u s 4 read with s 174 of the land acquisition act1894 for the meerut development authority.	F
it was followed by a notification dated 4th september1987 issued u s 6 of the acquisition act.	F
the said notification included the land of m s pootha farm a constituent unit of the company.	F
in the said case compensation amount of rs 4 33 crores was awarded by special land acquisition officer vide award dated 22nd february1990.	F
the district collector meerut pursuant to a report of the tehsildar ordered to pay the compensation amount after adjustment of different dues payable by the company 11 pursuant to a court 's order the district collector meerut passed a speaking order dated 20th february1992 showing the details of adjustments to be made out of compensation amount of rs 4 34 crores payable by the company as detailed below.	F
the district collector in the said order dated 20th february1992 concluded that after such adjustment the following dues were still to be paid by the company.	F
the state government filed the deduction statement for recovery of the dues before the prescribed authority constituted under u p sugar undertaking acquisition act1971 however the aforesaid claim was rejected by the prescribed authority by order dated 4th october1994 in claim no 13 of 1999.	F
against the said order dated 4th october1994 passed by the prescribed authority the appellant filed appeal no 195 before the appellate tribunal.	F
by order dated 12th october1995the appellate tribunal directed the appellant to file a fresh deduction claim before the prescribed authority.	F
the company moved an application before the district collector meerut stating therein that as on date there are no arrears liability payable by the company therefore requested to remove the receiver.	F
the district collector meerut by order dated 18th december1995allowed the case no 301995 with observation that as on the date no recovery certificate was pending against the company.	F
hence the appointment of receiver was terminated with immediate effect.	F
it was further ordered that a detailed list of the assets be prepared and signed by both the parties and the assets be transferred to the company.	F
an order was passed to appoint a chartered accountant to complete the audit of the accounts.	F
as the order dated 18th december1995passed by the district collector meerut is silent about the amount payable to the company the ex proprietor of the company moved an application before the chairman board of revenue and requested to refund the compensation amount to the company.	F
the company filed a writ petition no 102201996 before high court for modification of the order of the district collector meerut dated 18th december1995.	F
during the pendency of the said case the chairman board of revenue by order dated 3rd august1996 directed that out of the total amount of rs 4 33 crores received as compensation from meerut development authority after deduction of a sum of rs 1 62 crores along with interest and collection charges the balance amount shall be refunded to the company.	F
against the aforesaid order dated 3rd august1996 passed by the chairman board of revenue the company filed writ petition no 313781996 on the ground that there is no dues payable by the company.	F
in the said case the u p state sugar corporation ltd filed a counter affidavit refuting such stand taken by the company.	F
a separate counter affidavit was filed by the deputy secretary sugar and cane development lucknow giving details of dues payable by the company as detailed by the district collector meerut by his order dated 18th december1995.	F
the high court initially passed an interim order on 17th july1997 as under considering the facts and the circumstances of the case the respondents are directed to pay to m s ltd.	RLC
meerut the amount of compensation money amounting to rs 43394783 40 after deducting a sum of rs 16202402 20  interest and collection charges within a period of two months from today.	RLC
payments so made shall be subject to final decision of the writ petition.	RLC
against the interim order the appellant state filed the special appeals.	F
by judgment and order dated 7th july2010 passed in special appeal nos 5179 802010the high court quashed the interim order dated 17th july1997 passed by the learned single judge.	F
it was ordered to dispose of the writ petition expeditiously.	F
in the meantime the district collector by its notice dated 22nd august2005directed the company to refund certain amount.	F
the said notice was also challenged by the company.	F
the high court by judgment and order dated 23rd february2011 quashed the notice dated 22nd august2005.	F
with direction to the appellant to pay the compensation amount to the company.	F
however it was clarified that if the land which have been acquired finally does not fall within the ceiling limit of the company then it will be open for the state to recover it after the finalisation of the ceiling proceedings as per law.	F
subsequently impugned common judgment and order dated 1st.	F
march2011 was passed in writ petition no 313781996etc.	F
with observation and directions as referred to above.	F
the grievance of the appellant state is that the high court while passing the impugned order has not noticed the liability incurred by the undertaking and the loan paid to the company.	A
according to the appellant the aforesaid issue has not been decided.	A
on the other hand learned counsel for the respondents made the following submissions i no amount whatsoever is due and payable by the company to the state.	A
till date there has not been a single determination adjudication by any court authority of any dues against the company nor is there any claim pending before any authority or before any court on date.	A
furthermore the state has not been able to produce any recovery certificate of any department showing any dues against the company.	A
the collector has no power to adjudicate the dues under the u p zamindari abolition and land revenue act and is merely a recovery agent to recover sums payable as arrears of land revenue upon receipt of a valid recovery certificate.	A
we have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the records.	R
it is not in dispute that the company was under heavy arrears as on 3rd january1977 therefore the district collector meerut appointed the receiver.	R
subsequently sugar mill of the company was acquired on 28th october1984.	R
under sugar undertakings acquisition act1971 and the unit was vested with the u p state sugar corporation.	R
till 28th november1984the company was the owner of the units sugar mill.	R
it was in arrears to the extent of rs 1 29 crores.	R
therefore the district collector meerut attached remaining five constituent units and the general manager of the sugar unit was appointed as a receiver.	R
in between 1979 and 1984the state government extended a facility of loan to the extent of rs 6 13 crores to the receiver appointed by the state government for smooth functioning of the sugar mill including payment of dues to sugarcane grower repairing of machinery etc.	R
it is also not in dispute that labour and other dues were payable by the company apart from sale tax dues and the loan was given by the state government between 1977 1984 for payment of such dues.	R
the high court by the impugned judgment dated 1st march2011though noticed the aforesaid facts including the fact that the collector tulsi gaur by order dated 20th february1992 held that there were dues of about rs 10 44 crores payable by the company part of which can be adjusted from the compensation amount paid by the meerut development authority even thereafter an amount of rs 6 09 crores will remain payable by the company but the high court failed to address such issue.	R
the high court though noticed that s 8 of the u p state sugar undertakings acquisition act1971 empowers the prescribed authority to decide any dispute regarding the amount payable to any person or authority in respect of earlier liabilities of the undertaking but it wrongly held that in view of the provisions of the u p sugar undertakings acquisition act1971.	R
any liability incurred by the company or loan etc taken by the receiver is not payable by the company.	R
it is always open to the competent authority to seek recovery of the amount if due from the company or to adjust the dues.	R
the collector tulsi gaur was not a party by name.	R
the order dated 20th february1992 passed by the collector was also not under challenge inspite of the same the high court declared the order dated 20th february1992 as illegal.	R
for the reason aforesaid the impugned order dated 1st march2011 passed by the high court in w p no 10220 of 1996 etc cannot be upheld.	RPC
the same is accordingly set aside.	RPC
the matter is remitted to the district collector meerut to determine the liability of the company upto the date of vesting i e 28th october1984 after notice to the parties.	RPC
the authority while so determining shall take into consideration the liability of the company as on 28th october1984including labour charges sales tax loan amount given by the state government etc if payable.	RPC
after determination of liabilities and adjustment of the dues which is payable by the company if any amount is found payable to the company the appellant shall pay the amount within four months from the date of determination.	RPC
on the other hand if any amount is found payable by the company the competent authority may recover the amount in accordance with law.	RPC

after giving credit of rs 4 33 crores payable by the state government on account of amounts towards compensation for acquisition of land the liability of the company was determined at rs 6 09 crores on 20th february1992 a sale proclamation was accordingly issued.	F
the land of the company measuring 1 391 hectares in village maliyana was put to auction.	F

RLC
ltd being aggrieved by the said judgment preferred review application under order xlvii rule 1 cpc for review of the judgment and order dated 27th april2001 passed by the high court.	F
the review application was disposed of by an order dated 3rd september2001 with the following observations in view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances in my opinion it will meet the ends of justice if i grant three months time to the respondent no 2 and 3 to refund the amount in question to the auction purchasers application during this time the said amount shall positively be paid to them.

it is ordered accordingly.	RLC

the said case was also tagged with the aforesaid appeals.	F
in view of the fact that this court vide order dated 27th.	RPC
april2003 in c a nos 7123 7124 of 2003 held that this court is satisfied that no fault can be found with the impugned judgment of the high court so far as the setting aside of the sale is concerned we dismiss the appeals so far it relates to cancellation of auction sale.	RPC
we have heard the parties only on the limited question as to why the amount which has been directed to be refunded to the auction purchasers appellants herein should not bear reasonable interest.	R
in a situation like in the present case one can not hold of any statute entitling the auction purchasers to claim interest in case the auction got cancelled or set aside by the court of law.	R
counsel for the parties also could not refer any of the clauses of auction prescribing interest on refund of amount in case of cancellation of auction or sale.	R
the question arises as to whether in such a situation an auction purchaser can claim interest on equitable ground.	R
in state of maharashtra and others vs maimuma banu and others2003 7 scc 448 2003 indlaw sc 625the question arose as to whether interest was payable on rental compensation.	P
in the said case government resolution provided for payment of rental compensation expeditiously but no provision was made to pay interest in case of delayed payment.	P
this court in the said case held 10 the crucial question is whether there can be any direction for interest on rental compensation once it is held that the same has to be paid within the time frame notwithstanding the fact that there is no statutory obligation.	P
11 it is not in dispute that in certain cases payments have already been made.	P
though the inevitable conclusion is that the high court is not justified in directing grant of interest on the logic of various provisions contained in the act yet there is an element of equity in favour of the landowners.	P
it is however seen that the writ applications were filed long after the possession was taken.	P
this factor can not be lost sight of while working out the equities.	P
it would therefore be appropriate if the appellants pay interest.	P
6 from 1 4 2000 till amounts payable as rental compensation are paid to the landowners concerned.	P
this direction shall not apply to those cases where the payments have already been made prior to 1 4 2000 appeals are allowed to the extent indicated without any stipulation of costs.	P
in the present case we find that there was no mis representation on the part of the auction purchasers they deposited the total auction amount within the time stipulated.	R
it has not been in dispute that the title of the land was also transferred in their favour.	R
but for the reasons mentioned by the high court the sale has been cancelled.	R
it has been ordered to refund amount in favour of the auction purchaser appellants we find no reason as to why on equitable grounds the appellants should not get interest on the said amount.	R
taking into consideration the aforesaid factor while working out equities it would therefore be appropriate to direct the state to pay interest at the rate of 6 on the amount to be refunded as per the high court 's order with effect from 27th april2001 and 3rd.	R
september2001the day the high court passed the impugned order.	R
