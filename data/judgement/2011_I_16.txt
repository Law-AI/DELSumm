this appeal is directed against the final judgment and order dated 03 10 2007 passed by the high court of judicature andhra pradesh at hyderabad in criminal appeal no 436 of 2001 whereby the high court dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant herein and confirmed the judgment dated 19 03 2001 passed by the special judge c b i cases visakhapatnam in c c no 2 of 1998.	F
brief facts a the appellant accused was working as a head clerk in the traffic cadre section in the office of the senior divisional personnel officer south central railway vijayawada during the period from april1992 to november1997 the nature of duties of the appellant accused included dealing with and processing of the matters like promotions transfers seniority list roster list pay fixation on promotions retirements resignations etc of the personnel.	F
one k rama rao the complainant who was examined as pw 1was posted as yard points man grade a under station superintendent south central railway tanuku from december1995 to june1997 in june1997due to excess staff at tanuku.	F
he was instructed to report at head quarters vijayawada and accordingly when he reported there he was asked to go back to tanuku.	F
thereafter he went back to tanuku from where he was subsequently transferred to rajahmundry.	F
thereafter pw 1 made a representation to his senior officer requesting him for posting at vijayawada cheerala vetapalam or tenali.	F
later pw 1 was transferred to vijayawada.	F
as the appellant accused was dealing with the transfers the complainant pw 1 met him on 05 11 1997 at his office to pursue about the issuance of the said transfer order.	F
the appellant accused asked him to come on 10 11 1997 when he met him on 10 11 1997the appellant asked him to come on the next day as he was busy in pay fixation work.	F
on 11 11 1997again he went to the office of the appellant but he could not find him on his seat.	F
again a day after i e on.	F
13 11 1997when he met the appellant accused he informed him that his request for transfer has been processed and the order is ready and the same has been placed before the a p o for signature and asked him to come on the next day i e on 14 11 1997and demanded rs 200 for releasing the said office order.	F
on the same daypw 1 reported the matter in writing to the inspector of police central bureau of investigation in short the cbivijayawada.	F
on 14 11 1997a trap was laid by the cbi officials along with panchas and when the accused demanded and accepted a sum of rs 200 as illegal gratification he was caught red handed along with the money which was recovered from the right hand side pocket of his pant.	F
on 15 11 1997at 7 30 a m.	F
an fir was registered by the inspector cbi visakhapatnam branch in crime No.	F
rc 20a97 vsp after recording the statements of the witnesses inspector of police cbi visakhapatnam filed charge sheet being no 298 ytr dated 29 04 1998 against the appellant accused for an offence punishable under sections 7131dii read with s 132 of the prevention of corruption act1988 hereinafter referred to as the act in the court of special judge for cbi cases at visakhapatnam.	F
the special judge cbi by order dated 19 03 2001convicted the appellant and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of six months and to pay a fine of rs 500 and in default to suffer simple imprisonment for one month for the offence punishable u s 7 of the act and one year rigorous imprisonment with a fine of rs 500 and in default to suffer simple imprisonment for one month for the offence punishable u ss 131d ii.	F
read with s 132 of the act.	F
g against the said order the appellant accused filed criminal appeal no 436 of 2001 before the high court of andhra pradesh.	F
the high court by impugned judgment dated 03 10 2007 dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant accused and confirmed the conviction passed by the trial court.	F
hence the appellant accused has preferred this appeal by way of special leave petition before this court.	F
heard mr atm rangaramanujam learned senior counsel for the appellant and mr harish chandra learned senior counsel for the respondent.	F
notice only on quantum of sentence hearing on all aspects.	F
permissibility.	R
on 28 01 2008this court consisting of three honourable judges issued notice in this matter confining to the quantum of sentence only.	F
in pursuance of the same we permitted mr rangaramanujam learned senior counsel for the appellant to address his arguments confining to quantum of sentence imposed on the appellant accused.	F
as stated in the narration of facts the appellant was convicted u s 7 of the act for which he was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of rs 500 in default simple imprisonment for one month.	F
he was also convicted for the offence under s 131dii read with s 132 of the act and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year and fine of rs 500 in default simple imprisonment for one month.	F
the trial court ordered that both the sentences of imprisonment shall run concurrently.	F
the said conviction and sentence was affirmed by the high court.	F
if we confine ourselves to the limited extent of notice dated 28 01 2008we have to hear both sides only on the quantum of sentence.	F
however mr rangaramanujam learned senior counsel for the appellant by drawing our attention to the recent judgment of this court in yomeshbhai pranshankar bhatt vs state of gujarat2011 6 scc 312 2011 indlaw sc 370submitted that in spite of limited notice this court while exercising jurisdiction u art 142 of the constitution in order to do complete justice while hearing the matter finally can go into the merits of the orders passed by the trial court and the high court.	A
in the reported case the appeal was against the concurrent finding of both the courts convicting the appellant u s 302 ipc and sentencing him to suffer imprisonment for life.	A
at the slp stage this court by order dated 27 07 2009issued notice confined only to the question as to whether the petitioner was guilty of commission of an offence under any of the parts of s 304 indian penal code1860 in short ipc and not u s 302 ipc similar request was made before the bench that the appellant was entitled to urge all the questions including his right to urge that he should have been acquitted in the facts and circumstances of the case.	A
this court referred to the supreme court rules1966 which have been framed u art 145 of the constitution and also considered scope of its power u art 142 as well as order 47.	A
rule 6 of the code of civil procedure1908.	A
in short the code while deciding the said question the bench has also considered the scope of s 100 of the code for entertaining the second appeal.	A
it further shows that the court considered the plea of the appellant therein for acquittal despite the fact that the notice was limited in terms of the order dated 27 07 2009 it is relevant to point out that the bench in para 18clarified the position and reopened the case in its entirety even though notice was issued confining to a particular aspect.	A
after permitting the appellant therein to argue the case for acquittal on merits it observed we however make it clear that this can not be a universal practice in all cases.	A
the question whether the court will enlarge the scope of its inquiry at the time of final hearing depends on the facts and circumstances of the case.	A
since in the facts of this case we find that the appellant should be heard on all points we have come to the aforesaid conclusion.	A
emphasis supplied.	S
it is clear that the bench itself has clarified that they are not laying down the law that in spite of issuing notice confining to a particular aspect in the case on hand quantum of sentence the parties are entitled to urge all points and re open the case as if they are free to do the same without any restriction.	R
as a matter of fact the last sentence in para 18 makes it clear that in the facts and circumstances of that case they permitted the appellants to urge all points on merits.	R
in the case on hand it is to be noted that on appreciation of oral and documentary evidence led in by the prosecution and the defence and on appreciation of entire materials the court of first instance i e the trial court convicted the appellant and sentenced him as mentioned above.	R
the high court as an appellate court once again analysed all the material discussed the oral and documentary evidence and finding that the prosecution had proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt concurred with the conclusion arrived at by the trial court and dismissed the appeal of the appellant.	R
inasmuch as both the courts have thoroughly discussed the oral and documentary evidence with reference to the charges leveled against the appellant and in view of the limited order dated 28 01 2008 by this court issuing notice confining to quantum of sentence only and even applying the analogy enunciated in yomeshbhai 2011 indlaw sc 370 suprawe feel that it is not a case of such nature that the appellant should be heard on all points consequently we reject the request of the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant.	R
quantum of sentence.	R
whether requires any reduction.	R
mr rangaramanujam learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that inasmuch as the alleged incident took place on 14 11 1997 and 14 years have elapsed since then the amount of rs 200 said to have been received by the appellant is trivial in nature and also of the fact that due to the said conviction and sentence he lost his job leniency may be shown and sentence be reduced to the period already undergone.	A
he fairly admitted that out of the maximum period of one year the appellant had served only 52 days in prison.	A
with this factual position let us consider whether the request of the learned senior counsel for the appellant is to be accepted and sentence be reduced to the period already undergone.	A
it is not in dispute that the provisions of the prevention of corruption act1988 alone are applicable since the incident occurred on 14 11 1997 i e subsequent to the act.	R
s 7 of the act relates to public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act.	R
if the said offence charge is proved the court has no other option but to impose sentence of imprisonment which shall be not less than six months but which may extend to five years and also liable to fine.	R
the said section reads as under public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act  whoever being or expecting to be a public servant accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain from any person for himself or for any other person any gratification whatever other than legal remuneration as a motive or reward for doing or forbearing to do any official act or for showing or forbearing to show in the exercise of his official functions favour or disfavor to any person or for rendering or attempting to render any service or disservice to any person with the central government or any state government or parliament or the legislature of any state or with any local authority corporation or government company referred to in cl c of section 2or with any public servant whether named or otherwise shall be punishable with imprisonment which shall be not less than six months but which may extend to five years and shall also be liable to fine emphasis supplied.	S
s 13 deals with criminal misconduct by a public servant.	S
as per sub s 2 if any public servant commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine.	S
for clarity we reproduce the said section hereunder criminal misconduct by a public servant  1.	S
a public servant is said to commit the offence of criminal misconduct a if he habitually accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain from any person for himself or for any other person any gratification other than legal remuneration as a motive or reward such as is mentioned in section 7 or b if he habitually accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain for himself or for any other person any valuable thing without consideration or for a consideration which he knows to be inadequate from any person whom he knows to have been or to be or to be likely to he concerned in any proceeding or business transacted or about to be transacted by him or having any connection with the official functions of himself or of any public servant to whom he is subordinate or from any person whom he knows to be interests in or related to the person so concerned or c if he dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriates or otherwise converts for his own use any property entrusted to him or under his control as a public servant or allows any other person so to do or d if he i by corrupt or illegal means obtains for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage or ii by abusing his position as a public servant obtains for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage or iii.	S
while holding office as a public servant obtains for any person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage without any public interest or e if he or any person on his behalf is in possession or has at any time during the period of his office been in possession for which the public servant can not satisfactorily account of pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to his known sources of income.	S
explanation.	S
for the purposes of this section known sources of income means income received from any lawful source and such receipt has been intimated in accordance with the provisions of any law rules or orders for the time being applicable to public servant.	S
any public servant who commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine.	S
it is useful to refer that in the prevention of corruption act1947 the same criminal misconduct which is available in s 13 of the 1988 act had been dealt with in s 5 of the 1947 act.	S
s 52 of the 1947 act mandates that any public servant who commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine.	S
however proviso to sub s 2 of s 5 gives power to the court that for any special reasons to be recorded in writing impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than one year.	S
such relaxation in the form of a proviso has been done away with in the 1988 act.	S
to put it clear in the 1988 act if an offence u s 7 is proved the same is punishable with imprisonment which shall be not less than six months and in the case of section 13it shall not be less than one year.	S
no other interpretation is permissible.	S
other circumstances pleaded for reduction of sentence.	R
in order to substantiate the claim with the regard to the above learned senior counsel for the appellant has relied on the decision of this court in bechaarbhai s prajapati vs state of gujarat2008 11 scc 163 2008 indlaw sc 297 and based on the same requested this court to modify the sentence to the extent of period already undergone.	A
we have gone through the facts in that case.	R
it is true that even in the cited decision the appellant accused demanded only rs 250 and it was paid and accepted.	R
finally the special judge framed charges for offence punishable under sections 712131d read with s 132 of the act.	R
the appellant therein was convicted for offence u s 72 of the act and appeal before the high court was also dismissed.	R
thereafter the same was challenged before this court.	R
this court after holding that the conclusion of the trial court and high court does not suffer from any infirmity considered the alternative submission which related to harshness of sentence.	R
in that case taking note of the fact that the occurrence took place nearly seven years back and also of the fact that the appellant had suffered custody for more than six months considering all these aspects while maintaining the conviction this court reduced the sentence to the period already undergone.	R
since the appellant therein was convicted only u s 7 and s 161 cr.	R
pc the minimum sentence being six months and of the fact that he had suffered custody for more than six months the course adopted by this court is perfectly in order and the same can not be applied to the case on hand wherein the appellant had undergone only 52 days when the minimum sentence was six months u s 7 and one year u s 13.	R
learned senior counsel for the appellant further submitted that inasmuch as the incident had occurred on 14 11 1997 and the trial court has convicted him on 19 03 2001 which was affirmed by the high court on 03 10 2007at this juncture i e.	A
after a gap of 14 years there is no need to retain the same sentence and the court is not justified in directing the appellant to serve the remaining period after such a long time.	A
there is no dispute as regards the date of occurrence and the date of conviction passed by the trial court and affirmed by the high court.	R
inasmuch as the conviction on both counts have been confirmed by this court and we are confined to sentence part alone and in view of the minimum sentence prescribed u ss 7 and 13 of the act we are of the view that though long delay may be a ground for reduction of sentence in other cases the same may not be applicable to the case on hand when the statute prescribes minimum sentence.	R
accordingly we reject the said contention.	R
it was further contended that the amount alleged to have been received by the appellant accused is only rs 200 and he also lost his job after conviction by the trial court.	A
though these grounds may be attractive in respect of other offences where minimum sentence is not prescribed in view of our reasonings in the earlier paras the same can not be applied to the case on hand.	R
about the request based on delay that the appellant has lost his job undergone the ordeal all along etc a lenient view be taken in this case it is useful to refer decision of this court in state of m p vs.	P
shambhu dayal.	P
nagar2006 8 scc 693 2006.	P
indlaw sc 716 wherein it was held that it is difficult to accept the prayer of the respondent that a lenient view be taken in this case.	P
the corruption by public servants has become a gigantic problem.	P
it has spread everywhere.	P
no facet of public activity has been left unaffected by the stink of corruption.	P
it has deep and pervasive impact on the functioning of the entire country.	P
large scale corruption retards the nation building activities and everyone has to suffer on that count.	P
as has been aptly observed in swatantar singh v state of haryana1997 4 scc 14 1997 indlaw sc 1061corruption is corroding like cancerous lymph nodes the vital veins of the body politics social fabric of efficiency in the public service and demoralising the honest officers.	P
the efficiency in public service would improve only when the public servant devotes his sincere attention and does the duty diligently truthfully honestly and devotes himself assiduously to the performance of the duties of his post.	P
the reputation of corrupt would gather thick and unchaseable clouds around the conduct of the officer and gain notoriety much faster than the smoke.	P
art 142 and its applicability.	P
by drawing our attention to art 142 of the constitution of india learned senior counsel for the appellant vehemently submitted that in order to do complete justice this court has ample power to reduce the sentence even to the extent of period already undergone or any other order which would be beneficial to the parties approaching this court.	A
similar claim based on art 142 has been negatived in several decisions by this court we need to refer only the latest decision of this court in manish goel vs rohini goel2010 4 scc 393 2010 indlaw sc 301 the facts in that case are that the parties by persuasion of the family members and friends entered into a compromise and prepared a memorandum of understanding dated 13 11 2009in the proceedings pending before the mediation centre delhi by which they agreed on terms and conditions incorporated therein to settle all their disputes and also for dissolution of their marriage.	P
the parties filed an application under section 13 b1 of the hindu marriage act1955 before the family court delhi seeking divorce by mutual consent.	P
the said hma no 456 of 2009 came before the court and it recorded the statement of parties on 16 11 2009 the parties moved another hma no 457 of 2009 to waive the statutory period of six months in filing the second petition.	P
however the court rejected the said application vide order dated 01 12 2009 observing that the court was not competent to waive the required statutory period of six months under the act and such a waiver was permissible only under the directions of the supreme court as held by this court in anil kumar jain vs maya jain2009.	P
10 scc 415 2009 indlaw sc 1494 hence the parties have approached this court for appropriate relief.	P
speaking for the bench one of us dr.	P
justice b s chauhan referred to more than fifty decisions including the constitution bench judgments.	P
the relevant paras which are useful may be quoted we are fully alive of the fact that this court has been exercising the power u art 142 of the constitution for dissolution of marriage where the court finds that marriage is totally unworkable emotionally dead beyond salvage and has broken down irretrievably even if the facts of the case do not provide a ground in law on which the divorce could be granted.	P
decree of divorce has been granted to put quietus to all litigations between the parties and to save them from further agony as it is evident from the judgments in romesh chander v savitri.	P

7 scc 734 2008 indlaw sc 1077 however these are the cases where this court came to rescue the parties on the ground for divorce not provided for by the legislature in the statute.	P
in anjana kishore v puneet kishore 2002 10 scc 194 2001 indlaw sc 21204this court while allowing a transfer petition directed the court concerned to decide the case of divorce by mutual consent ignoring the statutory requirement of moving the motion after expiry of the period of six months under section 13 b2 of the act.	P
in anil kumar jain this court held that an order of waiving the statutory requirements can be passed only by this court in exercise of its powers u art 142 of the constitution.	P
the said power is not vested with any other court.	P
however we have also noticed various judgments of this court taking a contrary view to the effect that in case the legal ground for grant of divorce is missing exercising such power tantamounts to legislation and thus transgression of the powers of the legislature which is not permissible in law vide chetan dass v kamla devi 2001 4 scc 250 2001 indlaw sc 20206 and vishnu dutt sharma.

this court held as under sympathy or sentiment by itself can not be a ground for passing an order in relation whereto the appellants miserably fail to establish a legal right.	P
despite an extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction contained in art 142 of the constitution of india this court ordinarily would not pass an order which would be in contravention of a statutory provision.	P
in laxmidas morarji v behrose darab madan 2009 10 scc 425 2009 indlaw sc 1154while dealing with the provisions of art 142 of the constitution this court has held as under.	P
the power u art 142 of the constitution is a constitutional power and hence not restricted by statutory enactments.	P
though the supreme court would not pass any order u art 142 of the constitution which would amount to supplanting substantive law applicable or ignoring express statutory provisions dealing with the subject at the same time these constitutional powers can not in any way be controlled by any statutory provisions.	P
however it is to be made clear that this power can not be used to supplant the law applicable to the case.	P
this means that acting under article 142the supreme court can not pass an order or grant relief which is totally inconsistent or goes against the substantive or statutory enactments pertaining to the case.	P
the power is to be used sparingly in cases which can not be effectively and appropriately tackled by the existing provisions of law or when the existing provisions of law can not bring about complete justice between the parties.	P
emphasis added.	P
after elaborately discussing almost all the case laws on this subject about jurisdiction of this court under article 142summarised the same in the following words therefore the law in this regard can be summarised to the effect that in exercise of the power u art 142 of the constitution this court generally does not pass an order in contravention of or ignoring the statutory provisions nor is the power exercised merely on sympathy.	R
after saying so the court rejected the request of the parties to waive the statutory period of six months under the act.	R
in mota ram vs state of haryana2009 12 scc 727 2009 indlaw sc 682this court while reiterating the above principles has concluded that art 142 can not be exercised to negate the statutory provisions.	P
in academy of nutrition improvement and others vs union of india jt 2011 8 sc 16 2011 indlaw sc 515the following conclusion about the applicability of art 142 is relevant.	P
the question is having held that rule 44i to be invalid whether we can permit the continuation of the ban on sale of non iodised salt for human consumption for any period.	P
art 142 of the constitution vests unfettered independent jurisdiction to pass any order in public interest to do complete justice if exercise of such jurisdiction is not be contrary to any express provision of law.	P
in supreme court bar association v union of india 1998 4 scc 409.	P
1998 indlaw sc 688this court observed the supreme court in exercise of its jurisdiction u art 142 has the power to make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice between the parties in any cause or matter pending before it.	P
the very nature of the power must lead the court to set limits for itself within which to exercise those powers and ordinarily it can not disregard a statutory provision governing a subject except perhaps to balance the equities between the conflicting claims of the litigating parties by ironing out the creases in a cause or matter before it.	P
indeed this court is not a court of restricted jurisdiction of only dispute settling.	P
it is well recognised and established that this court has always been a law maker and its role travels beyond merely dispute settling.	P
it is a problem solver in the nebulous areas see.	P

711but the substantive statutory provisions dealing with the subject matter of a given case cannot be altogether ignored by this court while making an order u art 142 indeed these constitutional powers can not in any way be controlled by any statutory provisions but at the same time these powers are not meant to be exercised when their exercise may come directly in conflict with what has been expressly provided for in statute dealing expressly with the subject.

it may therefore be understood that the plenary powers of this court u art 142 of the constitution are inherent in the court and are complementary to those powers which are specifically conferred on the court by various statutes though are not limited by those statutes these.	P
powers also exist independent of the statutes with a view to do complete justice between the parties and are in the nature of supplementary powers.	P
and may be put on a different and perhaps even wider footing than ordinary inherent powers of a court to prevent injustice.	P
the advantage that is derived from a constitutional provision couched in such a wide compass is that it prevents clogging or obstruction of the stream of justice.	P
see supreme court bar association 1998 indlaw sc 688 supra.	P
though the jurisdiction of this court u art 142 of the constitution of india is not in dispute we make it clear that exercise of such power would however depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.	R
the high court in exercise of its jurisdiction u s 482 of the criminal procedure code and this court.	R
u art 142 of the constitution would not ordinarily direct quashing of a case involving crime against the society particularly.	R
when both the trial court as also the high court have found that the charge leveled against the appellant under the act has been made out and proved by the prosecution by placing acceptable evidence.	R
finally learned senior counsel for the appellant has cited certain orders of this court wherein this court has reduced the period of sentence already undergone while upholding the conviction.	A
we have perused those orders.	R
the orders do not disclose any factual details and the relevant provisions under which the accused was charged convicted and minimum sentence if any as available in the act as well as the period already undergone.	R
in the absence of such details we are unable to rely on those orders.	R
from the analysis of the above decisions and the concerned provisions with which we are concerned the following principles emerge a when the court issues notice confining to particular aspect sentence arguments will be heard only to that extent unless some extraordinary circumstance material is shown to the court for arguing the matter on all aspects.	R
long delay in disposal of appeal or any other factor may not be a ground for reduction of sentence particularly when the statute prescribes minimum sentence.	R
in other cases where no such minimum sentence is prescribed it is open to the court to consider the delay and its effect and the ultimate decision.	R
in a case of corruption by public servant quantum of amount is immaterial.	R
ultimately it depends upon the conduct of the delinquent and the proof regarding demand and acceptance established by the prosecution.	R
merely because the delinquent lost his job due to conviction under the act may not be a mitigating circumstance for reduction of sentence particularly when the statute prescribes minimum sentence.	R
though art 142 of the constitution gives wider power to this court waiver of certain period as prescribed in the statute imposing lesser sentence than the minimum prescribed is not permissible.	R
an order which this court can make in order to do complete justice between the parties must not only be consistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution but also it can not even be inconsistent with the substantive provisions of the relevant statute.	R
in other words this court can not altogether ignore the substantive provisions of a statute.	R
g in exercise of the power u art 142 of the constitution this court generally does not pass an order in contravention of or ignoring the statutory provisions nor is the power exercised merely on sympathy.	R
h the power u art 142 of the constitution is a constitutional power and not restricted by statutory enactments.	R
however this court would not pass any order u art 142 which would amount to supplant the substantive law applicable or ignoring statutory provisions dealing with the subject.	R
in other words acting under article 142this court can not pass an order or grant relief which is totally inconsistent or goes against the substantive or statutory enactments pertaining to the case.	R
i the powers u art 142 are not meant to be exercised when their exercise may come directly in conflict with what has been expressly provided for in statute dealing expressly with the subject.	R
in the light of the above discussion we are unable to accept any of the contentions raised by the learned senior counsel for the appellant on the other hand we are in entire agreement with the conclusion arrived at by the trial judge as affirmed by the high court.	R
consequently the appeal fails and the same is dismissed.	R
since the appellant is on bail the bail bonds executed by him stand cancelled.	R
the trial judge is directed to secure his presence for serving the remaining period of sentence.	RPC
appeal dismissed.	RPC
